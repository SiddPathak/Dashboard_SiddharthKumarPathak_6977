Power BI dashboard project under EduBridge BI Developer batch.
This is a Dashboard created by the sample dataset present on th POWER BI website called "AI SAmple dataset"

The Artificial Intelligence sample contains data for a fictitious company named Contoso AI. Myself as the Contoso AI sales manager created this report to understand their products and regions' key contributors for revenue won/loss, identify the highest or lowest breakdown of revenue, and determine if there are anomalies in their data. The campaign performance is being analysed by the help of this report
